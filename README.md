#### Project: CodeKataBattle
CodeKataBattle (CKB) is a new platform that helps students improve their software development skills
by training with peers on code kata. Educators use the platform to challenge students by creating code
kata battles in which teams of students can compete against each other, thus proving (and improving)
their skills.

You can view the meeting notes and discussions until today in the [Wiki](https://github.com/mehmetemreakbulut/AkbulutTopcuoglu/wiki) page of the project.

We mainly worked on OverLeaf. You can track the "History" from [Link]().
