The CodeKataBattle platform operates entirely through web interfaces, eliminating the need for specialized hardware interfaces. Users can access the platform using standard web-enabled devices, such as computers, tablets, and smartphones. The platform is designed to function within a web browser, requiring no specific hardware beyond a device capable of running a modern browser and accessing the internet. This approach ensures broad accessibility without necessitating particular hardware configurations, making the platform versatile and user-friendly across various hardware setups. However, for optimal experience, at least 2GB of RAM and a minimum of 1GB of free space are recommended for browser caching and temporary files.
